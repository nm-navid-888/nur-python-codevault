# 1. Assign and Print Variables

city = "Dhaka"
temperature = 35

print(city)
print(temperature)

# 2. Change the Value of a Variable

language = "Python"
print(language)

language = "JavaScript"
print(language)


# 3. Multiple Variables in One Line

x, y, z = 5, 10, 15
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# 4. Assign Same Value to Multiple Variables

a = b = c = "Nur"
print(a, b, c)

# 5. Combine Variables in Print

first_name = "Nur"
last_name = "Mohammad"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print(full_name)

# 6. Variable Types

x = 100
y = 99.5
z = True
name = "Nur"

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
print(type(name))

# 7. Arithmetic with Variables

price = 100
quantity = 3
total = price * quantity

print("Total price is:", total)

# 8. Practice Challenge

# Define your details
my_name = "Nur"
my_age = 25
my_country = "Bangladesh"

# Print a message using those variables
print(f"My name is {my_name}, I am {my_age} years old, and I live in {my_country}.")
